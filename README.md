Goals:
To add automatically 2 rows with the same string value, for this case to generate (show interface &lt;interface ID> | in CRC) on a Cisco router.

How to run the script:
1. Put the data_intf.txt in the same directory with triplicate_2.py
2. Open python terminal > hit python3 triplicate_2.py > enter
3. Extracted .txt file will prompt in the same directory, named with 3pli_{timestamp}.txt
